‚úÖ --> Done

‚ùå --> Not implemented yet


<h2>List of features</h2>


‚úÖ 1. Programming language: Kotlin is required, Java is optional.

‚úÖ 2. Design app's architecture (suggest MVVM)

‚úÖ 3. Apply LiveData mechanism

‚úÖ 4. UI should be looks like in attachment.

‚úÖ 5. Write UnitTests

‚úÖ 6. Acceptance Tests

‚úÖ 7. Exception handling

‚ùå 8. Caching handling

9. Secure Android app from:
  
      ‚úÖ a. Decompile APK
  
      ‚ùå b. Rooted device
  
      ‚ùå c. Data transmission via network
  
      ‚ùå d. Encryption for sensitive information
 
 10. Accessibility for Disability Supports:

      ‚ùå a. Talkback: Use a screen reader.
      
      ‚ùå b. Scaling Text: Display size and font size: To change the size of items on your screen, adjust the display size or font size.
      
      
 
 <h3>Brief explanation for the software development principles, patterns & practices being applied</h3>
 
  This project applied MVVM design pattern. With viewModel which will handle data for application/screen and drive UI.
  
  Also apply coroutine to simplify alot of works with asynchronous request
         
  Use JNI to hide some sensitive information (for appId key)
 
 <h3>Brief explanation for the code folder structure and the key Java/Kotlin libraries and frameworks being used</h3>

 api: For api service and resposne
 
 application: application class
 
 helper: for generic function
 
 loader: JNI loader
 
 model: for model class
 
 repo: for any source repo we need to get data from
 
 screen: for activity / screen
 
 ui (adapter / viewholder / view): contains all item we need to display on screen
 
 viewmodel: for viewModel which handlle logical between data and UI
 
 
 
 üí°<b>Lib/framework used in this project</b>
 
 AndroiX
 
 Kotlint/Coroutine
 
 Retrofit
 
 ViewBinding
 
 Gson
 
 JUNIT
 
 MockServer
 
 Espresso
 
 
 
 
 <h3>All the required steps in order to get the application run on local computer</h3>
 
 Just with normal import with default AndroidSDK/NDK then you can use this application
 
 <b>For instrumented testing, please chagne flag IS_MOCK_TEST_ENABLE in buildgradle application from false to true<b>
      
      true : use mock response for testing
      
      false : use response from OpenWeather service (default)
